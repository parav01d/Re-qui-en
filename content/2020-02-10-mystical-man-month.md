## About the book

The book deals with the typical problems in large IT development projects. The facts are pointedly presented, and you can quickly recognize yourself or your boss in the explanations. The author also writes about his own mistakes and what he has learned from them. In addition, solution strategies are presented, which of course are already being implemented today (after more than 30 years). Nevertheless, reading this classic is recommended, not to forget your own experiences.

The chapters are short and entertaining. As a result, the book is also suitable for distracting yourself for 10 minutes and reflecting on your own approach.

I recommend the book to everyone who works in IT development.
