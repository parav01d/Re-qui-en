## About this technique

In every project there are problems and risks that are foreseeable from the first second. These risks should be summarized in a document and given the chance of occurrence based on the assessment in the team. It is advisable to describe the problem in as much detail as possible and, if necessary, to file an emergency plan. Risks that cause a very high probability but little damage are not as explosive as risks that can cause a lot of damage.

If there are risks that are very likely and can cause great damage, then it is worthwhile to set up an emergency team that can respond to precisely this problem. Or create an issue for each sprint which tries to prevent this risk.

It is worthwhile to sensitize the team to errors and risks so that in an emergency it does not generate demotivation, but rather deals with the situation in a calm manner.
