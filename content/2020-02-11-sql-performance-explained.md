## About the book

Markus Winand gets to the point in a nutshell. The man knows 120% of what he is writing about. Quietly and pointedly, he explains for example that it is not a good idea on the MS SQL server to create a clustered index with more than one indexed column / table. Great: The book is written in really understandable language. You won't find any cryptic or nested sentences. After reading the book, one thing is clear: in the end, only the database developer can provide really good indexes. All others will probably only be able to solder something at certain points. My belief: The book is definitely part of the basic equipment of all database developers. It is definitely one of my best SQL / Databases bookshelves.
