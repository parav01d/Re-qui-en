## About this technique

The first step is to identify all stakeholders - ideally immediately after project planning. All individuals participating in the project, formal and informal groupings and the other project environment should be included and directly categorized ("internal / external", "supplier", "competitor", "customer"). In a next step, the identified stakeholders will be analyzed more specifically and evaluated and weighted based on project-specific influencing factors (content-related, organizational, social).

Based on the weightings worked out, a stakeholder map can be developed that visualizes the connection between influence and support (positive vs. negative) with the help of color-coded bubbles of different sizes and positions. In practice, the stakeholder analysis is often only carried out during project planning and subsequently or neglected in the further course of the project. The stakeholder analysis should, however, be continuously and continuously checked in all project phases and modified if necessary, as opinions change and information can be continuously reinterpreted and weighted. In addition, a continuous review enables a correction of initial misjudgments.

To identify all important stakeholders, ask yourself the following key questions:

- What is the goal of the project phase (the project), who draws positive and who negative consequences?
- Who is professionally involved? Who is involved in leadership? Who is involved strategically or in an advisory capacity?
- Who defines rules and framework conditions at which point?
- Who is the contact person for definable trades?
- What delimitable trades are there and what do they cause (e.g. noise, dust, etc.)?
- Which public bodies are involved and which should still be involved?
- Which regulations, laws and specifications have to be observed?
- Who is interested in achieving the project goal?
- Who is interested in the project goal not being achieved?
- Who has to give their approval for strategic decisions? Who has a VETO right?
- Who can make mood for or against the project?

### That's why you should do a stakeholder analysis

#### You can specifically address and convince negative stakeholders.

The output of the stakeholder analysis shows you which people or participants are negative about the project. In the best case, you will not only find out who is negative, but also why this attitude comes about.
With this knowledge, you can specifically refute the arguments or point out positive aspects.

#### You can guess which goals stakeholders are pursuing.

In contrast to nature, which mainly works according to a cause and effect principle, people act according to a personal motive. You can find out why stakeholders act, how you act and thus infer the motives of individuals or groups.

#### Your image improves.

At first glance it reads like a cheap advertising lie. But can be logically substantiated:
By addressing stakeholders in the initial analysis and later reassessment, everyone involved feels taken seriously. A brilliant side effect: Those who feel taken seriously and respected see the project, the process and the project manager with benevolent eyes. The number of negative stakeholders naturally decreases when there is a feeling that fears and expectations are taken seriously.

#### Project marketing measures can be used and planned more precisely.

You know which people or groups have which reservations, reviews or attitudes. In this way you can initiate project marketing measures in a targeted manner. The scattering of fog candles is avoided. Protects the budget and does not make the marketing indicators flash red.

#### Uncover "influencers" and use them for your own purposes.

Does one of the stakeholders have the ability or ability to involve, convince and inspire others through his character or position? Mark this person thick, neon green and blinking. Drag that person to your side. Unthinkable without stakeholder analysis.
