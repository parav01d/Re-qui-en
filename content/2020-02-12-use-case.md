## About the Pattern

> These use cases orchestrate the flow of data to and from the entities, and direct those entities to use their Critical Business Rules to achieve the goals of the use case.

[Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design](/clean-architecture-a-craftsmans-guide-to-software-structure-and-design)
<br/><br/>
The use case encapsulate a procedure described by his behaviour. In the case of behaviour driven development we define e2e tests like this:
```
GIVEN A user called "John" which is authorized to get user information

  AND A user called "Smith"

 WHEN The user called "John" gets user information

 THEN The Response contain "Smith"
```
The when task describe the main functionality of the use case and the then block contains the functional requirements. Each use case can be executed and have a deterministic behaviour. In my applications I encapsulate:

* Access Control
* Validation
* Hydration
* Repository
* Service

from the use case to make them lightweight and easy to understand. A dependency injection container will help you to make the use cases easy to unit test and will help you to exchange dependencies in e2e tests.

## Example

In this example we take a look at a find filtered and paged user implementation. The whole use case encapsulate the business logic. To make it better readable and separate concerns we use services and repositories. The external event helps us to register logging services and notify external services with an message queue.

```javascript
injectable();
export class FFAPUserUseCase extends AbstractUseCase implements IUseCase {

    public static DOMAIN_EVENT_NAME: string = "UserFoundFilteredAndPagedEvent";

    public constructor(
      @inject(FrameworkServiceModule.EventService) protected userAccessControl: IUserAccessControl,
      @inject(FrameworkServiceModule.EventService) protected eventService     : IEventService,
      @inject(RepositoryModule.UserRepository)     protected userRepository   : IUserRepository,
    ) {
        super();
    }

    public async execute(query: FFAPUserQuery, currentAccount: Account): Promise<User[]> {

        this.checkAuthentication(currentAccount);

        this.validate(query);

        this.userAccessControl.allowedToGetUser(currentAccount)

        const { pagination } = query;
        const users = await this.userRepository.get({ pagination });

        this.eventService.fireDomainEvent({ name: FFAPUserUseCase.DOMAIN_EVENT_NAME, account: currentAccount, payload: query, target: users });

        return users;
    }
}
```

You see, 8 lines of code cover the following points:

* The Account which made the request is authenticated
* The Request Data encapsulated in an query DTO is valid
* The Account which made the request is allowed to make this operation
* The requested Data is fetched from the Database
* External Services are notified about this operation
