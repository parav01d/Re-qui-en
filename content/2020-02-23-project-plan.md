## About this technique

According to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), a project plan is: "...a formal, approved document used to guide both project execution and project control. The primary uses of the project plan are to document planning assumptions and decisions, facilitate communication among project stakeholders, and document approved scope, cost, and schedule baselines. A project plan may be summarised or detailed."

The project plan typically covers topics used in the project execution system and includes the following main aspects:

- Scope management
- Requirements management
- Schedule management
- Financial management
- Quality management
- Resource management
- Stakeholder management â€“ New from PMBOK 5
- Communications management
- Project change management
- Risk management

The easiest way to start is creating a table with 5 columns. The first one is the enumeration of tasks, the second one the name of the task, third fourth and fifth is duration start and end date of the task. To make these information more readable, you can create a Gantt-Diagram which presents the duration in the form of bars on a timeline.

Today there are different strategies in agile software development management frameworks like SCRUM or KANBAN to archive good predictions for task durations and risks. In general is worth to make 3 or 4 milestones to archive the goal. It's a WIN-WIN situation for you and for the team, because it's really motivating archiving a goal and make a party or something else, on the other hand you can evaluate failures way faster.
