## About the Book

Exactly the book you should read starting with reactive extensions. It's all about structures and patterns used by scaleable reactive applications. Most interesting part for me was the fault tolerance and recovery patterns and some flow control strategies. There are only 300 pages so buy this book and take you a weekend.
