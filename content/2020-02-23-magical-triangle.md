## About this technique

Did you ever heard about the "Magical Triangle"? As a developer I have nearly 50 every day use principles and patterns in my mind. Each of them are really straight forward like "Dependency-Inversion"-Principle or "Single-Responsibility"-Principle and now I make my first steps in project management and read something like "Magical Triangle". I mean "Magical Triangle" ... is this the way you economically savvy dudes name patterns? To make it short here is what it means:

The Success of the Project depends on the following 3 Parameters:

- time
- money
- quality

and these Parameters should be balanced to avoid:

- delay
- overpay
- poor quality / over engineering

Thats it, not more, not less. For real, if YOU call this "Magical"? You should spend some years in software development and you will understand, this is a very oversimplified pattern without any magic at all. Pffft.. magical .. You know there was a man and he had to debug a app which would crash very rarely. It would only fail on Wednesdays -- in September -- after the 9th. Yes, 362 days of the year, it was fine, and three days out of the year it would crash immediately. The system would format a date as "Wednesday, September 22 2008", but the buffer was one character too short -- so it would only cause a problem when you had a 2 digit DOM on a day with the longest name in the month with the longest name - Finding this Bug is magical.
