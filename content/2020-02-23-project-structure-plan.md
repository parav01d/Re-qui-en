## About this technique

A project is divided into subtasks and work packages as part of the structuring. Subtasks are elements that have to be subdivided further, work packages are elements that are at the lowest level in the WBS and are not subdivided further there. Work packages contain the operations that are required for the further planning stages.

Three methods have been established for creating project structure plans:

#### Top-down approach

The deductive way leads from the whole to the detail, the PSP is formed by dismantling from the project to the work packages.
Name the project
Selection of the appropriate orientation method for the second level
Breakdown of the overall project into sub-projects or sub-tasks
List of tasks or structural elements of the second level
Selection of the appropriate orientation method for each element of the second level
Further disassembly until work packages are available
This procedure is often chosen if experience with similar projects is already available or the content of the project to be planned is largely known.

#### Bottom-up approach

The inductive path leads from the detail to the whole, the PSP is formed by putting together from the activity to the project.
Collection of tasks to be carried out in the project
Analysis of relationships with the question of what is part of what
Structure and composition to a tree structure
Control of completeness and uniqueness of all tasks
This process is suitable for projects with a high degree of innovation.

#### Yo-Yo technique

In the countercurrent process, deductive and inductive steps are carried out alternately in order to use the strengths of both processes. In order to use this method sensibly, however, it should not be used for a too small section of the project.

In order to ensure that no tasks have been forgotten and that no tasks occur more than once, the following rules should be observed:

Uniqueness: The structural elements of a level must be completely different in terms of content.
Completeness: The total content of the elements belonging to a parent element must match the content of the parent element.
