## About the Book

The book offers a few pages an overview of the area of machine learning. The various techniques are clearly explained and are followed by examples of their use. The implementation details are not dealt with, the book is quite understandable. I recommend it to everyone who wants to get a quick overview of the application areas of "machine learning".
