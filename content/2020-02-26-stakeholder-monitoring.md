## About this technique

The initial analysis of stakeholders are not enough if you have a bigger group of it. The best way to have an easy overview is to make a chart with to axis.
The first one is the conflict potential and the second one is the influence of the stakeholder on the project. Now you set a marker of each stakeholder on this chart and move them, depending on your email communication and other influences, to their actual position. Now you have an every day overview about the current situation of your stakeholders.

* You should pay the most attention to the stakeholders who are on the top right of your visualization, because they have the greatest influence and potential for conflict.
* Then you should focus on the stakeholders who have a lot of influence but no potential for conflict - they are in the box at the top left.

Stakeholders can be a big win on the one hand, but also a risk for the project on the other. Good stakeholder management is therefore very helpful for project success.
