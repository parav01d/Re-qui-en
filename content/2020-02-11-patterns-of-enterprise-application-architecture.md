## About the book

Martin Fowler has once again written an upcoming classic. In the first part of the book, numerous basic aspects and questions to which software architecture is exposed are discussed and the possible solution compared. I have been looking for such an overview for a long time. In the second part, Fowler uses the pattern form to detail individual aspects, i.e. also to look at the implementation. In contrast to many other Patterns books, the chosen form is not very formal, easy to read and appropriate to the problems.

Some people say that the book by the Gang of Four contains the most important patterns, but this book should be mandatory reading for every engineer of enterprise applications!
