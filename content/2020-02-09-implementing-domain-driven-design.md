## About the book

After reading Eric Evans' blue DDD book, I got this one and I personally found it's the perfect addition. The numerous and extensive code examples make many of DDD's concepts and patterns much easier to understand than the blue book alone. Without Vaunghn Vernon's work, I would never have been able to master my first DDD project.

I can recommend anyone who is serious about developing projects based on the patterns of DDD to deal intensively with this work. In addition to deepening the fundamentals of DDD, the author gives numerous tips on the use of DDD in connection with different architectural styles and shows many examples and demonstrates the use of different technologies. In addition, there are countless implementation notes for each individual pattern.

This book should not be missing in any architect's bookshelf!
