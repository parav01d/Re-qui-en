## About this technique

In my experience, teams usually form in two ways.

The first way is natural team building without external influence. This is usually done on the basis of sympathy and friendship. Even though it is said in many books that these teams are not as performant as others, I have found that long-term motivation is very high and the level of stress is very low. However, these teams often take on tasks that exceed the capabilities of the individual employees. This often results in a working solution, but this is usually of poor quality. Monitoring the team and their competencies is therefore essential and tasks that are unsuitable for the team should be taken over by people who are temporarily added to the team. This procedure is good for the further training of employees and the willingness to access third-party competencies is much higher if the period is defined.

The second way to form a team is based on the skills and characteristics of the individual employees.

Common personas are:

**The Thinker**

He is quick to grasp relationships, and as a rule he works very precisely. He does not attach great importance to the team, often he does not express his own suggestions, but waits for instructions from above.

**The Teamworker**

He always thinks of the people in the team first. He is characterized by a high degree of group feeling. He always wants a harmonious team.

**The Maker**

He is confident and actively contributes suggestions to the team, but occasionally tends to go it alone. However, it is good for him to convince the other members of his opinion.

A good team should preferably consist of different characters who can work well together. I would not recommend forcing a team to work in a particular constellation.

The reality is of course different. But it definitely helps to characterize the individual members. Various techniques can be used, which I will link here later.
