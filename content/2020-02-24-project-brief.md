## About this technique

 A project brief provides an overview of the most important project facts. He makes sure that you have to think about different things at the beginning of the project and don't forget anything. The project brief creates a common understanding between the client and the project manager and in later project phases, he helps to remember the original project again.

In general, however, the following project parameters should be included:

- Project description
- project objectives
- project participants
- project deadlines
- project costs
- risks

Usually, a profile is briefly formulated and presented on one page.

And yet a very essential point is missing. The answer to the following questions:

- Why should the project be carried out at all?
- What do we get from it?
- What improvement are we aiming for in the current situation?
