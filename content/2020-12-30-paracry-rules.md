## Why do we play ParaCry instead of Warcry?

A year ago I started playing WarCry and since I didn't like the two standard warbands, I bought a Start Collecting Box from Maggotkin of Nurgle - Rotbringers. Like all Rotbringers players, I was more than disappointed with the opportunities I had in WarCry. The entire game was completely unbalanced and lacked not only units but also meaningful skills. At the end of 2020 the new Grand Alliance books came out and the new units made many warbands more interesting. However, the abilities "Onslaught" and "Haste" were the only ones played besides the four-in-hand.

With my new game board, the games were now even more boring, as the weaknesses of the individual factions were even more evident. Some factions had what felt like 100 different units and others only 10. To bring everything back into line I decided to develop this game. The individual factions are subdivided again and have skills that are tailored to the individual units. Each faction also has a passive ability that is supposed to better bring out the variety of the subgroup. The Points and Attributes of the Units stay untouched so you can still use your cards and books (2020).

## Rules

I really like the simplicity of the WarCry rules so all of them staying untouched, except by the specific units with specific abilities for each subgroup of a fraction.

## Game Development

We play one or two times a week with this rules and change them from time to time. At the beginning the Rules will be changed often because we balance the game by playing it.
