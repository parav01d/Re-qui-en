## About the book

Clean Architecture is basically one idea repeated over and over for 30 chapters. The idea is that the business logic should be self-contained. It should not depend on the database or sockets or frameworks or GUI. It is a really, really good idea, and it is not easy to actually follow. However, the idea could have been explained in a lot less than 300 pages.
At the end there is a 50-pages appendix where Robert Martin describes many of the projects he worked on, from the early 1970s to the 1990s. Many of the problems from those projects are interesting case studies that you can learn from - I quite enjoyed reading those stories (somewhat to my own surprise).
