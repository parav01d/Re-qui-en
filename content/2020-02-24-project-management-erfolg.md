## About the Book

Basically, every professional activity should be divided into projects. As soon as you understand this point, you can be successful in my view, even if the work only really starts. From my point of view, you learn to manage these projects very well here in the book. It provides all the foundation for managing projects and the key factors of the projects. Definitely worth a recommendation for beginners.
