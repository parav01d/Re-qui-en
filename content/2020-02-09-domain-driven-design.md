## About the book

Highly recommended for junior developers on their way to become a master programmer. Topics like ubiquitous language, model, domain object lifecycle, core domain definition and useful patterns are well defined inside the book. The second part of the book seems a little bit confusing, but Jimmy Nilson save this part with useful DDD-Patterns. But be careful, you won't understand this book 100% the first time you read it. But after 5 to 10 years of software craftsmanship you will understand, this book is really useful if you wanna write large scalable applications without loosing control after 2 years.
