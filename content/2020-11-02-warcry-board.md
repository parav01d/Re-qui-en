## Modular Warcry Board

Hello Fellows, I've been building my Warcry Board for half a year now. After showing it on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCry/comments/jksw50/showcase_modular_warcry_board/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I was asked how it came about and what steps I took. This is the story of deadly pandemics and happy quarantines.

<br></br>

### My Birthday Party

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/old_field.jpg "Old Warcry Field")

As always, I got a lot of toys for my birthday. This time it was all about Warhammer Age of Sigmar and Warcry. But this time there was that special moment when I got 1 kilogram of printable material. I don't know how much a kilogram is, but at first I assumed it was a lot but the future will teach me better.

<br></br>

### Looking For 3D Printing Files

At first I tried [Ulvheim Szenario](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2762318) but after taking a look at the ~500 little bit different parts, I gave up. After a few days of procrastinating I found [Infinite Dimensions Games](https://www.infinitedimensions.ca/). They have some cool [Map Tiles](https://www.infinitedimensions.ca/product/medieval-cobbled-streets/), [Walls](https://www.infinitedimensions.ca/product/medieval-modular-3d-printable-walls/) and [Gantries](https://www.infinitedimensions.ca/product/improvised-defence-gantries/). I thought a combination of these three elements will be a good fundament for a warcry board for competitive gaming ( Catacombs will be released in a half year at this Point).

<br></br>

### Everything Needs A Plan

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/paper_plan.JPG "Warcry Board Paper Plan")

After spending some time in Keynote putting together a combination of map tiles, walls and gantries with various shapes and colors, the conception phase failed to display the entire project in 3D with visualization software. The Mc Gyver in me was armed with scissors and cardboard within a short time and the individual parts (12 "x 12") could be put together for the first time as a test.

<br></br>

### The Print Job Gift

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/printer.JPG "3D Printer")


<br></br>

### Painting The Walls

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/wall_1.JPG "Wall 1")
The printed parts are not 100% waterproof, so I primed all parts with [Abaddon Black](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Abaddon-Black-2019) first. To better prepare the surface for the next layers. I've read a lot about sanding the surfaces with 500 grit sandpaper, however I decided against it because it looks not THAT bad and I am more the player then the painter.

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/wall_2.JPG "Wall 2")
After the primer I applied a layer [Rakarth Flesh](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Rakarth-Flesh-2019) and painted 50% of the stones with [Bugman's Glow](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Bugmans-Glow-2019), [Balor Brown](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Layer-Balor-Brown-2019) and [Zandri Dust](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Zandri-Dust-2019). I used [Leadbelcher](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Leadbelcher-2019) for the grille but that should be clear visible. Maybe you ask yourself why I use [Rakarth Flesh](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Rakarth-Flesh-2019) instead of a more greyish color. On the one hand, the base color becomes very gray after the shade, on the other hand, the flesh color gives a warmer result. In the end, you still play the game at the kitchen / living room table. It should stay cozy there.

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/wall_3.JPG "Wall 3")
A coat or two of [Nuln Oil](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Shade-Nuln-Oil-2019) later, the wall should look something like this.
 
<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/wall_4_1.JPG "Wall 4_1")
Now you can drybrush with [Rakarth Flesh](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Rakarth-Flesh-2019) again and you will see that the bright colors disappear and a beautiful wall results.

<br></br>


![alt text](/images/warcry-board/wall_3_1.JPG "Wall 3_1")
Then a little [Typhus Corrosion](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Technical-Typhus-Corrosion-2019) with [Ryza Rust](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Dry-Ryza-Rust-2019) and the wall is ready for use. But keep in mind, there are a hell of a lot of walls.

<br></br>

### Painting The Roof

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/map_1.JPG "Floor 1")
Here we are again painting the whole surface with [Rakarth Flesh](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Rakarth-Flesh-2019) after priming everything with [Abaddon Black](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Abaddon-Black-2019).

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/map_2.JPG "Floor 2")
Now I painted 5-10% of the stones with [Bugman's Glow](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Bugmans-Glow-2019), [Balor Brown](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Layer-Balor-Brown-2019) and [Zandri Dust](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Zandri-Dust-2019) and a blue and green I don't remember. But for real who cares? Except for the way, I smeared the entire plate with [Nuln Oil](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Shade-Nuln-Oil-2019).
 
<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/map_3.JPG "Floor 3")
After adding a lot of sunlight, all I had to do was coat the paths with [Agrax Earthshade](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Shade-Agrax-Earthshade-2019) and as soon as everything was dry, I went over it with the makeup brush and [Rakarth Flesh](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Rakarth-Flesh-2019).

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/map_4.JPG "Floor 4")
So that you can distinguish the panels from the walls at the end, I added a little bit of [Biel-Tan Green](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Shade-Biel-Tan-Green-2019) and [Coelia Greenshade](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Shade-Coelia-Greenshade-2019).

Pro Tip: Be careful with the [Coelia Greenshade](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Shade-Coelia-Greenshade-2019). It looks a little bit unrealistic.

<br></br>

### Painting The Gantries
![alt text](/images/warcry-board/gantries_1.JPG "Gantries 4")
Ha HA ha! We had some smaller issues printing these little piles of wood. But who cares because this is way more realistic. Not every gantry look the same in real, checkout your city for comparison. No gantries? You should take over the city while it's unprotected.

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/gantries_2.JPG "Gantries 4")
I forgot to take a series of photos about it, but the whole thing is not as spectacular as it looks. I primed 50% of the woods with [Dryad Bark](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Base-Dryad-Bark-2019) and 50% of the woods with [Rhinox Hide](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Base-Rhinox-Hide-2019). Please make sure that the first 50% are different then the second 50%, otherwise a part will remain black. Now you brush part of [Mournfang Brown](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Base-Mournfang-Brown-2019), part of [Mournfang Brown](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Base-Mournfang-Brown-2019) mixed with [Mephiston Red](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Base-Mephiston-Red-2019) and part of [Mournfang Brown](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Base-Mournfang-Brown-2019) mixed with [Averland Sunset](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Base-Averland-Sunset-2019). If I remember correctly I used [Zandri Dust](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Base-Zandri-Dust-2019) with a layer of [Ushabti Bone](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Layer-Ushabti-Bone-2019) for the Ropes.

<br></br>

### Testing The Board
![alt text](/images/warcry-board/example_1.JPG "Example 1")
Honestly, the first game was awesome. We tried not to climb over the wall and to keep the targets shielded by the walls (it was not possible to take a target through a wall). The whole game felt much more balanced and strategic. I would assume the current Catacombs set plays very similarly. One of my friends plays Corvus Cabal and asked me if we might get a few heights. We will see ...

<br></br>

### A Dream About Heights and Lows
![alt text](/images/warcry-board/dream.JPG "Dream")
At some point I got this picture suggested on Instagram and thought: This is exactly what we need. So I looked on Amazon for hard foam blocks with 6 "to 6" with different heights and found [these ones](https://www.amazon.de/Sculpture-Block-151550-Hartschaumblock-Modellierblock/dp/B01E5WMYO8). There are cheaper alternatives out there and I can recommend trying another one because these are very crumbly.

<br></br>


### PU Foam Boxes From Hell

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/PU_0.JPG "PU_0")
I'm very bad at drawing straight lines with the hobby knife aka the kitchen knife. That's why I opted for the more expensive variant, in which the boxes already have the finished dimensions. They have three different versions: [flat](https://www.amazon.de/Sculpture-Block-Hartschaumblock-Modellierblock-anfertigen/dp/B00W9WVBUK), [mid](https://www.amazon.de/Sculpture-Block-151550-Hartschaumblock-Modellierblock/dp/B01E5WMYO8), and [height](https://www.amazon.de/Sculpture-Block-151575-Hartschaumblock-Modellierblock/dp/B01E5WMZAG).

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/PU_1.JPG "PU_1")
I tried a little to see if I could put together enough combinations with the given boxes. It was not that easy because I already printed the roof plates with different street styles.

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/PU_2.JPG "PU_2")
Look at that! That was about the point where I started wearing a mask. There is no warning sign on the packaging, but after the bridge I felt like I had shortened my life by about 2 years.

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/PU_4.JPG "PU_4")
I thought it might be a nice idea to freshen up the water with a few highlights. I'm supposed to be right, it was a good idea.
 
<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/PU_5.JPG "PU_5")
That's not what it looks like: Small PU foam blocks in hibernation. No no, I brushed all of them with a layer of epoxy resin and laid them on different surfaces to dry. A few of these were a good idea and a few others weren't.
 
<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/PU_6.JPG "PU_6")
I spent several hours removing the cork sheet from the rock-hard foam blocks. Protip at this point: wear a mask! Epoxy resin dust is toxic.
 
<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/PU_7.JPG "PU_7")
The blocks get really hard, so really hard. That's why I put these little cushions on to not ruin my table. By the way, you will have noticed that I primed all the blocks with [Abaddon Black](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Abaddon-Black-2019).
 
<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/PU_8.JPG "PU_8")
Here we are again, this is the part where we painting the walls (again). After the primer I applied a layer [Rakarth Flesh](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Rakarth-Flesh-2019) and painted 50% of the stones with [Bugman's Glow](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Bugmans-Glow-2019), [Balor Brown](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Layer-Balor-Brown-2019) and [Zandri Dust](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Zandri-Dust-2019). Maybe you ask yourself why I use [Rakarth Flesh](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Base-Rakarth-Flesh-2019) instead of a more greyish color. On the one hand, the base color becomes very gray after the shade, on the other hand, the flesh color gives a warmer result. In the end, you still play the game at the kitchen / living room table. It should stay cozy there.
<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/PU_9.JPG "PU_9")
Yeah it's okay.

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/PU_10.JPG "PU_10")
Adding some Details here ...
<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/PU_11.JPG "PU_11")
... and there.
<br></br>


### Epoxy Me A River

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/river_0.JPG "River 0")
After watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TwpB7sVMn8) video everything was clear. I had to do my part for the corona pandemic and buy a lot of toilet paper. On principle!

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/river_1.JPG "River 1")
I covered three layers of toilet paper with a layer of wood glue diluted with water. With the tip of a thick brush, I carefully pressed the waves out. It's hard to describe, but it comes about when you do it yourself. 

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/river_2.JPG "River 2")
This is the result if the first evening. Now everything needs 72h to dry.
<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/river_4.JPG "River 4")
When it dries it looks something like this.
<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/river_5.JPG "River 5")
Now I've applied a thick coat of [Creed Carmo](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Creed-Camo-2019). Be careful it needs some time to dry. Now the edges can be shaded with [Agrax Earthshade](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Shade-Agrax-Earthshade-2019) and [Athonian Camoshade](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Shade-Athonian-Camoshade-2019).
 

<br></br>

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/river_6.JPG "River 6")
After priming the copper pipe with Abaddon Black I had to create something again that looks like a copper pipe. A layer of [Balthasar gold](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Base-Balthasar-Gold-2019) shaded with [Reikland Fleshshade](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NZ/Shade-Reikland-Fleshshade-2019) ( no gloss! ). Finally I added some highlights with [Nihilakh Oxide](https://www.games-workshop.com/de-DE/Technical-Nihilakh-Oxide-2019).

<br></br>

### Special Parts

![alt text](/images/warcry-board/special_0.JPG "Special 0")
This is a special part that works on its own as a 1 inch plate and is otherwise suitable for raising another block by 1 inch.
