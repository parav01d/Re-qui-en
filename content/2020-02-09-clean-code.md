## About the book

Bob Martin's Clean Code is, in my opinion, one of the most valuable books for anyone involved in software development. Regardless of whether agile software development or not, everyone should have read Clean Code. No matter whether junior or senior developer.

Especially in today's time of technology madness, where more and more software is being cobbled together "quickly and cheaply", the quality and the manual art of software development often falls by the wayside. If you want to develop software that should be maintainable, expandable and scalable, and should survive a longer period (> 10 years), you will hardly be able to avoid the basic principles described in this book.
