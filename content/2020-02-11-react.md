## About the book

The authors did an excellent job introducing React. All important concepts that are required to create complete React applications are presented using a sample application (a service for online surveys), which also deals with topics that go beyond the core functionality of React, such as the connection of a REST API Servers and the flux architecture. The latest technologies are used throughout, especially the ES2015 language features (which are explained separately in the appendix). Everything is well structured and clearly presented, without unnecessary ballast, but without any noteworthy gaps. This book is exactly the React introduction that I wanted.
