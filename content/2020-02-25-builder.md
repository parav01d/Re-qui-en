## About the Pattern

This is one of my favourite creational patterns. Combined with a static factory method and a fluent interface it brings readability and useability to the next level.

Take a look at this beauty

```javascript
export default class Business implements IBusiness {
  private readonly _id: string;
  private readonly _name: string;
  private readonly _description: string;
  private readonly _createdAt: Date;

  static builder(): BusinessBuilder {
    return new BusinessBuilder();
  }

  constructor(data: IBusiness) {
    this._id = data.id;
    this._name = data.name;
    this._description = data.description;
    this._createdAt = data.createdAt;
  }

  get id(): string {
    return this._id;
  }

  get name(): string {
    return this._name;
  }

  get description(): string {
    return this._description;
  }

  get createdAt(): Date {
    return this._createdAt;
  }
}
```

and the corresponding builder:


```javascript
export default class BusinessBuilder {
  private id?: string;
  private name?: string;
  private description?: string;
  private createdAt?: Date;

  setId(id: string): BusinessBuilder {
    this.id = id;
    return this;
  }

  setName(name: string): BusinessBuilder {
    this.name = name;
    return this;
  }

  setDescription(description: string): BusinessBuilder {
    this.description = description;
    return this;
  }

  setCreatedAt(timestamp: string): BusinessBuilder {
    this.createdAt = new Date(timestamp);
    return this;
  }

  build(): Business {
    return new Business({
      id: this.id,
      name: this.name,
      description: this.description,
      createdAt: this.createdAt,
    });
  }
}

```

Finally the usage:

```javascript
const business = Business.builder()
                    .setId("1")
                    .setName("Oh my Business")
                    .setDescription("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.")
                    .build()
```
<br></br>

If you have multiple nested objects you can provide their builders in the setter methods as higher order function. You know what I mean? Let's take a look:


```javascript
export default class Business implements IBusiness {
  private readonly _id: string;
  private readonly _name: string;
  private readonly _description: string;
  private readonly _address: Address;
  private readonly _location: Location;
  private readonly _createdAt: Date;

  static builder(): BusinessBuilder {
    return new BusinessBuilder();
  }

  constructor(data: IBusiness) {
    this._id = data.id;
    this._name = data.name;
    this._description = data.description;
    this._address = data.address;
    this._location = data.location;
    this._createdAt = data.createdAt;
  }

  get id(): string {
    return this._id;
  }

  get name(): string {
    return this._name;
  }

  get description(): string {
    return this._description;
  }

  get address(): Address {
    return this._address;
  }

  get location(): Location {
    return this._location;
  }

  get createdAt(): Date {
    return this._createdAt;
  }
}
```

and the corresponding builder:


```javascript
export default class BusinessBuilder {
  private id?: string;
  private name?: string;
  private description?: string;
  private address?: Address;
  private location?: Location;
  private createdAt?: Date;

  setId(id: string): BusinessBuilder {
    this.id = id;
    return this;
  }

  setName(name: string): BusinessBuilder {
    this.name = name;
    return this;
  }

  setDescription(description: string): BusinessBuilder {
    this.description = description;
    return this;
  }

  setAddress(callback: (builder: AddressBuilder) => Address): BusinessBuilder {
    this.address = callback(Address.builder());
    return this;
  }

  setLocation(callback: (builder: LocationBuilder) => Location): BusinessBuilder {
    this.location = callback(Location.builder());
    return this;
  }

  setCreatedAt(timestamp: string): BusinessBuilder {
    this.createdAt = new Date(timestamp);
    return this;
  }

  build(): Business {
    return new Business({
      id: this.id,
      name: this.name,
      description: this.description,
      address: this.address,
      location: this.location,
      createdAt: this.createdAt,
    });
  }
}

```

Finally the usage:

```javascript
const business = Business.builder()
                    .setId("1")
                    .setName("Oh my Business")
                    .setDescription("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.")
                    .setAddress(
                      (addressBuilder) => addressBuilder
                        .setStreet("St Marks Ave")
                        .setZipCode("12 32 B")
                        .setCity("New York")
                        .setCountry("USA")
                        .build();
                    )
                    .setLocation(
                      (locationBuilder) => locationBuilder
                        .setLongitude("73.927128")
                        .setLatitude("40.673959")
                        .build()
                    )
                    .build()
```

With this technique you have a nice auto suggestion in your IDE and a really small amount of import statements.

You should understand this pattern before writing your next line of code.
