    <h3>After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless.</h3>
    <p>Seven years ago, I started trying to be the best at programming. I read really many books and coded the hell out of me only to understand in the end:</p>
    <p> There is no constructor or instance of master programmer.</p>
    <p>Only a team of highly skilled individuals with strong collaboration intends is able to create good software. So I became a strong part of several companies, wrote a lot of beautiful code (of cause with a mechanical keyboard) and make nice concepts to establish business models. But yeah like every other super hero there is another side of the medal, I cannot be the all time coding monkey because most importantly I am a human, with a little family and a lot of hobbies. I play magic cards, fly freestyle drones, go bouldering and at last but not least I spend a lot time with my girlfriend and my son. My favourite colours are green, orange and sometimes violett (Have you ever seen a lavender field? It looks so beautiful).</p>

Because the team was not very experienced, I laid the foundations for project management and collaboration.</p>
    <p>• initialised the backend infrastructure (Express, Postgres, Docker, RabbitMQ) and architecture using domain driven design and clean architecture ( hijacked the bootstrapping process and manipulating the dependency injection container to run e2e test directly against the code )</p>
    <p>• wrote the first version of the Smartplatz app with react native and the second version with expo ( not released yet )</p>
    <p>• created a concept for in app user interest tracking based on their interactions</p>
